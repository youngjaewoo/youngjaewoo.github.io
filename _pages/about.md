Hello, this is Youngjae Woo (legal name: Young Jae Woo). Welcome to my blog site! I started writing about genetics and drug development stories scattered around the web, mostly for my self-learning. Hope you enjoy :)

In real life, I practice data-driven analysis to identify novel drug targets and understand its function in humans. Working with big biomedical data and applying novel methods to give a new light unto these data are few things that I enjoy. I am passionate about translating science into clinical practice and this has been one of my motivation for transitioning into industry roles.
